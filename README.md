NUS course coordinators and tutors need a convenient system to
manage student grades. We propose a program to track students 
and their performance on graded components, utility functions 
to get statistics on the cohort and certain subgroups,
ability to tag students (eg. dropped module, potential TA etc.),
alongside general GUI improvements.
